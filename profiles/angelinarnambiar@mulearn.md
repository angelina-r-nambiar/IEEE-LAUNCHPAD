#### Leadership and Influence:

I believe I have strong leadership skills and my experience as vimukthi club president during my school days has definitely encouraged me to take up a lot of leadership roles without any self doubt. In my opinion, leader is not just a person who leads the people and orders the other people around, but leader is more like a person who will stand infront of the team during failure and take the backseat in the face of success.I consider even the smallest oppurtunity of leadership extremely precious and being and executive commitee member of Enix has motivated me to carry on the the expertise in leadership that I gained from school.A lot of factors has influenced me to be a better leader over the course of time. Of all those facotrs, my teachers, who believed I could be a great leader and their hopeful eyes had influenced me the most.

My peer group also had so many friends who had been my greatest well wishers and have been an honest critic to all the decisions I have made as a leader.  

#### Networking:

For me, networking has always been about genuine connections—getting to know people, learning from their experiences, and sharing what I know in return. I enjoy being part of tech events, online communities, and team projects where ideas flow freely. These interactions have helped me grow, stay inspired, and discover new perspectives.

Going forward, I plan to stay active in the local tech scene—joining meetups, contributing to open-source projects, and hosting small workshops to help others explore electronics and innovation. I want to be someone people can turn to for support, collaboration, or even just a chat about new ideas.

As an electronics engineer, I see leadership as more than just guiding a team—it’s about being approachable, staying curious, and encouraging others to think creatively. I hope to use my skills not just to build cool things, but to help build a community where we all grow together.

#### Career Plan:
In the short term, I want to be hands-on in supporting Kerala’s startup community. I plan to engage with young founders by sharing what I’ve learned—whether that’s through mentoring, workshops, or just being part of conversations at events and incubators. I’m especially interested in helping students and early-stage entrepreneurs connect their ideas to real-world impact, and bridging the gap between education and innovation.

Looking ahead, I hope to play a more active role in shaping a stronger, more inclusive startup ecosystem across the state. That means working with others—policymakers, investors, and community leaders—to make it easier for people to start up, especially outside the big cities. I want to help create more opportunities for funding, better infrastructure, and a culture that supports risk-taking and creativity.

One of my long-term goals is to connect Kerala’s startups with the global stage, tapping into the experience and networks of the Malayali diaspora. I’m also passionate about supporting ventures that solve real problems in health, agriculture, sustainability, and education—areas where Kerala can truly lead.

More than anything, I want to be part of building an ecosystem where innovation is driven by purpose, and where startups grow not just fast, but meaningfully.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

-Kerala has everything it takes to become a thriving hub for tech startups. With one of the most educated populations in the country and a growing number of talented graduates, the foundation is already strong. What’s needed now is the right support system—stronger industry-academia ties, better access to hands-on training in areas like AI, blockchain, and IoT, and more opportunities for young minds to turn their ideas into action.

Building more startup spaces and incubators—not just in Kochi but in cities like Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode—can spread the spirit of innovation across the state. At the same time, easier access to funding through local investors, government grants, and simpler policies will make it easier for people to take the leap into entrepreneurship.

Kerala also has a unique chance to lead in building startups that actually make a difference—whether it’s in clean energy, healthcare, education, or agriculture. And with a global Malayali network spread across the world, there’s so much potential for mentorship and international connections.

By celebrating local success stories and encouraging rural innovation, Kerala can grow a startup culture that’s inclusive, bold, and future-ready. With the right push, the state could become a beacon for sustainable and meaningful entrepreneurship.
